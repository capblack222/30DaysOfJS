# 30DaysOfJS
It Contains the projects implemented from scratch, from the WesBos 30DaysOfJavascript Challenge.

It does not keep the record of all of the projects as I am following the WesBos Challenge for learning purposes but I also do not want to copy and paste the HTML and CSS parts, so the projects which I make from scratch will be added in this repo.
